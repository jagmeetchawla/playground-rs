PARKED IDEAS
────────────

These are real, considered proposals that have been deliberately set aside.
Each has a rationale. Revisit when the time is right.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IDEA: Native Swift + Monaco Hybrid (v2.0 rewrite candidate)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: Parked — finish current Tauri version first
Logged: 2026-04-01

Background
  The current stack (Tauri + Svelte + WKWebView) has produced recurring classes
  of bugs that are hard to diagnose or fix without deep knowledge of multiple
  layers: DOM event propagation, WKWebView limitations, Tauri v1→v2 API changes,
  Svelte 4 vs 5 idiom drift. The bugs themselves are fixable but the debugging
  path is opaque — you'd need to hold Svelte → WKWebView → Tauri → Rust → macOS
  in your head simultaneously.

  Swift Playgrounds and Xcode both use fully custom native editors (built on
  NSTextView). Those are proprietary and unavailable. The best open-source
  native option is Runestone (Tree-sitter based), but it doesn't match Monaco's
  quality for a code editing tool.

Proposed Architecture
  Native SwiftUI app with one isolated WKWebView for the editor pane only.

  │  Toolbar: native NSToolbar                              │

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  - Everything except the editor is native SwiftUI / AppKit
  - The WKWebView hosts only Monaco — no Svelte, no Tauri bridge
  - Swift ↔ Monaco communication via WKScriptMessageHandler (JS → Swift)
    and evaluateJavaScript (Swift → JS) — simple, well-documented, stable
  - Cmd+S, Cmd+R, Cmd+N handled at AppKit level (NSMenuItem / @FocusedValue)
    before they reach the WebView — no keyboard capture fights
  - Drag-drop, file dialogs, context menus all native — no workarounds needed
  - Rust runner stays as a plain Process (Foundation) — same logic, cleaner API
  - Storage: same ~/Library/Application Support layout as current v0.1.x

Why This Is Better
  - Menus, shortcuts, drag-drop, dialogs just work
  - Crashes and errors have clear Swift stack traces
  - Debugging path: Swift → Rust process, nothing else
  - The Monaco WKWebView is isolated — can't interfere with native UI events
  - Code is readable and fixable without knowing Svelte/Tauri internals

Why It's Parked
  - Current Tauri version works and is improving
  - Switching mid-stream loses momentum
  - Swift development is slightly slower (more API lookup needed)
  - Worth doing as a clean v2.0 rewrite once v0.1.x feature set is stable
    and we know exactly what we're rebuilding

Trigger Condition
  Revisit when v0.1.x hits a hard wall — a feature that genuinely can't be done
  cleanly in Tauri — or when the current version feels "done" and a rewrite
  makes sense as a quality investment.
